Vesper is a lightweight, powerful toolkit designed for the modern security researcher focused on API penetration testing. It automates the tedious parts of reconnaissance and includes a dedicated suite for finding and exploiting common JWT vulnerabilities, allowing you to focus on what matters: finding critical flaws.

---

## ‚ú® Features

Vesper's capabilities are organized into two main categories: Reconnaissance and JWT Attacks.

#### Reconnaissance
-   **Endpoint Discovery (Wordlist):** Brute-force common API endpoint paths from a provided wordlist.
-   **Endpoint Discovery (JavaScript Analysis):** Intelligently parse linked JavaScript files on a target to discover hidden or undocumented API paths.
-   **Unauthenticated Access Scanning:** Automatically test a list of discovered endpoints to find sensitive functionality exposed without authentication.

#### JWT (JSON Web Token) Operations
-   **Token Decoder:** Quickly parse any JWT to clearly view its header and payload.
-   **`alg=none` Attack:** Automatically generate a malicious token with the signature stripped, testing for the classic signature bypass vulnerability.
-   **HS256 Secret Key Brute-Forcer:** A multi-threaded cracker to rapidly guess weak HS256 secret keys from a wordlist.
-   **HS256 Token Forger:** Create and sign your own custom JWTs with any payload and secret key for advanced testing.

## üöÄ Installation

Vesper is designed to be simple to set up.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/KoushiqMurad/vesper.git](https://github.com/KoushiqMurad/vesper.git)
    cd vesper
    ```

2.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guide

Vesper is controlled via command-line arguments. Below are examples for every feature.

### **Reconnaissance**

> **Note:** All recon commands require the `-d` or `--domain` flag.

-   **Discover endpoints using a wordlist:**
    ```bash
    python main.py -d example.com -w wordlist.txt
    ```

-   **Discover endpoints by analyzing JavaScript files:**
    ```bash
    python main.py -d example.com --js
    ```

-   **Discover endpoints and then check them for unauthenticated access:**
    ```bash
    python main.py -d example.com --js --auth
    ```

-   **Save all output to a file:**
    ```bash
    python main.py -d example.com --js --auth -o results.txt
    ```

### **JWT Operations**

> **Note:** All JWT commands require the `-t` or `--token` flag, or the `--jwt-sign` flag.

-   **Decode a JWT to view its contents:**
    ```bash
    python main.py -t "eyJhbGciOi..." --jwt-decode
    ```

-   **Perform the `alg=none` signature bypass attack:**
    ```bash
    python main.py -t "eyJhbGciOi..." --jwt-alg-none
    ```

-   **Brute-force an HS256 secret key using a wordlist:**
    ```bash
    python main.py -t "eyJhbGciOi..." --jwt-bruteforce -w passwords.txt
    ```

-   **Forge a new HS256 token with a custom payload and secret:**
    ```bash
    python main.py --jwt-sign --payload '{"admin":true,"user":"koushiq"}' --secret 'supersecret123'
    ```
